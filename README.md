# How do I approach designing software?
The first approach I take with designing software is understanding the software program I am using to then be able to visualize what I want to do with that project I'm working on. The design skills I learned from this project helped me understand which types of images work regarding textures which will help me in the future when having to deal with textures in another project. The design process I used was mostly just visualizing what I wanted the program to look like when launched by using the image I was using as reference as well as my own dining table for the parts of the image I personally didn't like.

# How do I approach developing programs?
The first step I make sure to make when developing programs is by first outlining what I know needs to be done for instance if I know that the entire program will have 6 functions, I'll split those functions up into days for developing while making sure there is enough time before the deadline to tweak anything if the code doesn't compile properly. Some new development startegies I learned were while developing the functions for adding lights and textures. The strategy I used was to keep compiling my code while placing the lights to ensure that the lighting was accurate and I would know which light was the problem by compiling as soon as I placed a new light after the previous one was how I wanted it.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science can help me reach my career goals by learning coding languages as well as common starategies with programming to help me when I want to enter the field of programming or anything computer related as my career goal is to have a job that deals with computers in some sort of way.
